In the Cloud where everyone checks upto efficiency, faster throughput and response times in milliseconds, a simple way to get started is to convert some of your relational SQL databases into NoSQL documents. NoSQL engines like Apache Cassandra and MongoDB fetch chunks of data within single digit milliseconds providing the faster response time which earlier to this, used to take a second.

Today, we are looking at doing a Windows installation of Distribution of Apache Cassandra™ (DDC) (found here https://academy.datastax.com/planet-cassandra/cassandra). It is a free packaged distribution of Apache Cassandra™ made available by DataStax. Besides Apache Cassandra™, it includes DataStax DevCenter tool which is a CQL client for your cassandra installation.
