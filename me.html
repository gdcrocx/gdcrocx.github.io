    <p>Hi, I am George Davis and I am recent author and an author by choice. I have treaded across different technologies of the past and the present and been pursuing this journey of mine for about 4 years now. My curiosity feeds my interests in technology and use it to quickly gather requirements, design, develop, provision and deploy them.</p>

    <p>I have worked on multiple in-house and professional projects for various top end clients and upcoming startups. My works range from <strong>Core Java, .Net (C#), NodeJs and Python</strong> in programming and is listed in the chronological order. I have decent knowledge on relational and non-relational databases like <strong>Microsost SQL, MySQL, MongoDB and DataStax Cassandra</strong>.</p>

    <p>An agile enthusiast and a process driven developer.</p>

    <p>Worked with Cloud technologies for quite sometime, OpenStack deployments, VMWare (a short while) and <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>. I was managing two clusters of 20-23 servers each at one point of time deployed on <strong>OpenStack</strong> for IaaS, PaaS and DBaaS.</p>

    <p>Currently working for a major telecommunications player, with their <strong>Cloud Migrations and DevOps deployments</strong>.</p>

    <p>I have a Masters degree on Free and Open Source and love Open source for the most part.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in knowing more or if you have a challenge for me, I would be glad to know about it.</p>
