Hi, I am George Davis and I am recent author and an author by choice. I have treaded across different technologies of the past and the present and been pursuing this journey of mine for about 4 years now. My curiosity feeds my interests in technology and use it to quickly gather requirements, design, develop, provision and deploy them.

I have worked on multiple in-house and professional projects for various top end clients and upcoming startups. My works range from Core Java, .Net (C#), NodeJs and Python in programming  and is listed in the chronological order. I have decent knowledge on relational and non-relational databases like Microsost SQL, MySQL, MongoDB and DataStax Cassandra.

An agile enthusiast and a process driven developer.

Worked with Cloud technologies for quite sometime, OpenStack deployments, VMWare (a short while) and Amazon Web Services. I was managing two clusters of 20-23 servers each at one point of time deployed on OpenStack for IaaS, PaaS and DBaaS.

Currently working for a major telecommunications player, with their Cloud Migrations and DevOps deployments.

I have a Masters degree on Open Source and love Open source for the  most part.

If you are interested in knowing more or if you have a challenge for me, I would be glad to know about it.
